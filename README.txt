This is a stitchwork of the Adafruit Library for 16x32 and 32x32 RGB LED matrix panels, the adaptation by Hiduino to use multiple displays and the PImage functions from Adafruits TFT library.

This gives the functionality to load BMP-images from an SD-Card and show it on the matrix display. Due to register/pin use this has only been tested on Arduino Mega ADK.
